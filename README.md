Code from my 2014 science fair entry North by NortWest.

Because of the file sizes involved, the folder for the original images only contains 8 example images. This is sopposed to be enough to show the code works.

*01_process_images.R*

Reads the images from the folder figures out the swatch area, and saves colour information from the swatches as a csv file. Creates one csv file per image.

02_processed_to_csv.R

Makes one summary csv for each image swatch from all the images.

03_poster_Graphs.R

Makes the line graphs created for the project from the allinfo file

04_circle_plot.R

Makes the circle graphs created for the project from the allinfo file. Since the experiment goes around in a cricle, this kind of graph makes sense.
