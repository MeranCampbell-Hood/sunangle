ReadMe: North by Northwest Data

This is the raw data for my science fair project- pictures taken at a series of dates and times of the same swatch of colours. The camera and swatch was rotated through a 360 degree compass direction at 45 degree points
 taking a picture at each stop. This gave a series of pictures taken under the same outdoors conditions but a different angles to the sun.

The photos were taken in Dunedin
 New Zealand
 when the sun was predominantly in the NorthWest.

As well as the photos
 the metadata.csv file includes information about the pictures. The settings of the camera and the weather (based on the nearest 5 minute reading of a local weather station (thank you to the University of Otago, Physics Department). The variables in metadata.csv are:

"CreateDate5" - creation date in 5 minute intervals, for linking to weather station 
"SourceFile" - Photo filenames
"direction" - Direction camera was facing. 
"ISO"
"Aperture"
"LightValue"
"ShutterSpeed"
"CreateDate"
"GLOBAL"
"UVA"
"UVB"
"VISIBLE"
"RAIN"
